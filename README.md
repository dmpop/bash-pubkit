# About Bash Pubkit

Bash Pubkit is a package for compiling books in the EPUB format from Markdown-formatted text files and accompanying images, fonts, and CSS stylesheets. Bash Pubkit comes with a book template and the _compile.sh_ Bash shell script that uses [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to generate books in the EPUB format.
